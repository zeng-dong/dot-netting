## C# 10 Unit Testing
## Matthew Renze, 2022: [Writing Testable Code](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=ab525ece-3822-4b6c-8138-e9e9938e0ac9)
### Creating Seams in code
Solution: test the class but not any of its dependencies
- decouple dependencies
- program to interfaces
- inject dependencies
- test in isolation

#zdnote basically he says programming to interfaces. He also mentioned and used AutoMoqer. But I thought AutoMoqer reduced readability.

## Unit Testing Fundamentals
Has one segment talking about "Writing Testable Code", but is too general.
Basically,  listed Design principles:
- Separation of concerns
- Seams
- SRP (SOLID)
- Encapsulation (OO)
- Dependency injection
- Dependency inversion (SOLID)
And the Aim is
- Loosely coupled code
And the Why is
- Functionality/behavior can be isolated/separated for unit testing.
