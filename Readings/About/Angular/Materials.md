# azure-blue
In Angular Material 18, you should use the "azure-blue" theme ==when you want a modern, default appearance with a primary color that leans towards a light blue==, as it is the pre-built theme based on Material 3 design principles, which heavily features the "azure" color palette as its primary option. 

Key points about using "azure-blue":

- **Material 3 standard:**
    
    "Azure-blue" is considered the primary theme for Material 3 in Angular Material 18, meaning it aligns with the latest design guidelines and provides a consistent look across different Material components.

# rose-red
In Angular Material 18, the "rose-red" color palette isn't directly available as a pre-built theme. However, you can achieve a similar look by creating a custom theme.

When to use a "rose-red" like theme:

- **Branding:** If your brand colors align with shades of red and pink, a custom "rose-red" theme can reinforce your brand identity.
- **Visual Emphasis:** Use it to highlight specific elements or sections of your application.
- **Emotional Impact:** Red and pink hues can evoke emotions like passion, excitement, or warmth, which can be strategically used in your design.
