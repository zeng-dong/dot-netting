## The Daily Scrum and Empiricism

-- from # 18 Paragraphs That Will Make Your Daily Scrum Better[https://turboscrum.com/better-daily-scrum/#more-3858]  

You may recall that Scrum is founded on empirical process control. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

The pillars of empiricism are transparency, inspection and adaptation. Every event in Scrum is a formal opportunity for inspection and adaptation and the Scrum Guide makes it very clear what is inspected and adapted in the Daily Scrum:

> The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.


# Functional Review

## functional requirements
<thoughts>
Okay, the user is asking about functional requirements in software engineering. Let me start by recalling what functional requirements are. They define what the software should do, right? So, the user probably wants a clear explanation of what these requirements are, maybe examples, and how they differ from non-functional ones.

First, I should define functional requirements. They are specific behaviors or functions that the system must perform. For example, in a login system, a functional requirement might be allowing users to reset their password. I need to make sure the explanation is straightforward.

Then, I should provide examples. Maybe break them down into categories like user requirements, system functions, business rules, and data handling. That structure will help the user understand different contexts where functional requirements apply.

Next, I should explain how functional requirements are different from non-functional. Non-functional are about how the system works, like performance or security, while functional are about what the system does. Including a comparison table would make this distinction clear.

The user might also be interested in why functional requirements are important. So, I should mention aspects like guiding development, ensuring alignment with user needs, and serving as a basis for testing. It's crucial to highlight their role in the development lifecycle.

I should also think about how these requirements are documented. Use cases, user stories, and functional specifications are common methods. Providing examples of each, like a user story format, can be helpful.

Maybe include best practices too. Things like being specific, traceable, and avoiding technical jargon. This helps the user understand how to write effective functional requirements.

Wait, the user is asking for "functional requirements for software engineering." Are they a student, a new developer, or someone involved in project management? The answer should be accessible to someone without deep technical knowledge but thorough enough to be useful.

Also, check if there are any common mistakes people make when defining functional requirements, like being too vague. Including pitfalls to avoid would add value.

Let me organize this: definition, examples, differences from non-functional, importance, documentation methods, best practices, and common pitfalls. That structure should cover the topic comprehensively.

I need to make sure the language is clear and avoid unnecessary jargon. Use bullet points and tables where possible for readability. Including real-world examples, like an e-commerce system, can make the concepts more concrete.

Double-check that all information is accurate. For example, functional requirements vs. non-functional: functional is about what, non-functional about how well. Examples of each are correct. The documentation methods like use cases and user stories are appropriate.

Also, mention that functional requirements are part of the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. That ties it into standard practices.

Finally, wrap it up with a key takeaway to reinforce the main points. Make sure the answer is thorough but not overwhelming, balancing depth with clarity.
</thoughts>

### **1. What Are Functional Requirements?**
Functional requirements specify **actions the system must perform** to deliver value to users. They answer questions like:
- What tasks should the system accomplish?
- How should the system respond to specific inputs?
- What outputs or results are expected?

**Example**:  
For an e-commerce app, functional requirements might include:  
- Users can search for products by name or category.  
- Users can add items to a shopping cart.  
- The system calculates taxes and shipping costs during checkout.  

---

### **2. Key Components of Functional Requirements**
Functional requirements typically describe:  
- **User interactions** (e.g., login, data entry, reporting).  
- **Business rules** (e.g., discounts apply only to orders over $50).  
- **Data handling** (e.g., how data is stored, retrieved, or validated).  
- **System integrations** (e.g., connecting to payment gateways or APIs).  
- **Workflows** (e.g., order approval steps for a manager).  

---

### **3. Examples of Functional Requirements**
| **Category**          | **Example**                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Actions**       | "The user can upload a profile photo in JPEG or PNG format."                |
| **Data Validation**    | "The system must validate email addresses using regex before submission."   |
| **Business Logic**     | "A 10% discount is applied if the user spends over $100."                   |
| **Reporting**          | "Generate a monthly sales report in PDF format."                            |
| **Integration**        | "The app must integrate with PayPal for payment processing."                |

---

### **4. Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**
| **Functional Requirements**                     | **Non-Functional Requirements**                      |  
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|  
| Define **what** the system does.                 | Define **how well** the system performs.             |  
| Focus on **features and behaviors**.             | Focus on **quality attributes** (e.g., speed, security). |  
| Example: "Users can reset passwords via email."  | Example: "The system must load pages in under 2 seconds." |  

---

### **5. Why Are Functional Requirements Important?**
- **Guide Development**: Provide clear instructions for developers and testers.  
- **Align Stakeholders**: Ensure everyone agrees on what the system should do.  
- **Basis for Testing**: Enable test cases to verify if the system meets expectations.  
- **Reduce Ambiguity**: Prevent scope creep or misunderstandings during development.  

---

### **6. How Are Functional Requirements Documented?**
They are often captured in:  
- **Use Cases**: Scenarios describing user-system interactions (e.g., "Place Order").  
- **User Stories**: Agile-style statements like:  
  *"As a customer, I want to filter products by price so I can find affordable items."*  
- **Software Requirements Specification (SRS)**: A formal document detailing all requirements.  
- **Wireframes/Mockups**: Visual representations of features (e.g., UI layouts).  

---

### **7. Best Practices for Writing Functional Requirements**
- **Be Specific**: Avoid vague terms like "user-friendly" (e.g., "The search bar must autocomplete after 3 keystrokes").  
- **Use Active Voice**: "The system **shall** validate user input" instead of passive phrasing.  
- **Prioritize**: Rank requirements (e.g., "must-have" vs. "nice-to-have").  
- **Ensure Traceability**: Link requirements to design, code, and test cases.  

---

### **8. Common Pitfalls to Avoid**  
- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Failing to define how the system handles errors or unusual inputs.  
- **Mixing with Non-Functional**: Confusing performance goals (e.g., "fast") with functionality.  
- **Ambiguity**: Using terms like "support" without clarity (e.g., "support mobile devices" vs. "optimized for iOS and Android").  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
Functional requirements are the **backbone of software development**. They translate user needs into actionable specifications, ensuring the final product delivers the right features and behaviors. Without them, teams risk building a system that fails to meet expectations or solve real-world problems.


## how to do functional analysis in scrum

```
Okay, the user is asking about how to do functional analysis in Scrum. Let me start by recalling what functional analysis entails. Functional analysis in software development usually refers to breaking down a system's functions into components to understand what the system should do. Now, integrating that into Scrum, which is an Agile framework, I need to think about how that fits into the Scrum process.

First, I should consider the roles in Scrum. The Product Owner is responsible for the product backlog, which contains user stories and requirements. The Development Team works on delivering increments each sprint. Functional analysis would probably involve the Product Owner and the team working together to clarify requirements.

In Scrum, the main artifacts are the product backlog, sprint backlog, and the increment. Functional analysis might be part of refining the product backlog. Backlog refinement is when the team reviews and clarifies items in the product backlog to prepare for upcoming sprints. So, during refinement, the team could perform functional analysis by breaking down user stories into smaller, more manageable pieces and understanding the functionality required.

User stories are a big part of Scrum. They are short descriptions of a feature from the user's perspective. Functional analysis would involve decomposing these user stories into tasks, identifying acceptance criteria, and ensuring that the team understands the functional requirements. Acceptance criteria are conditions that a product must satisfy to be accepted by the user, so they are crucial for functional analysis.

I should also think about the Definition of Ready. This is a set of criteria that a user story must meet before it can be pulled into a sprint. Part of functional analysis would be ensuring that user stories meet the Definition of Ready, meaning they are well-understood, estimated, and have clear acceptance criteria.

Another aspect is collaboration. In Scrum, the team works collaboratively, so functional analysis should involve discussions between the Product Owner, developers, testers, and other stakeholders. Techniques like user story mapping or example mapping might be used to visualize and analyze the functionality.

Testing is also part of functional analysis. The team needs to ensure that each user story is testable. This could involve creating test cases during backlog refinement or sprint planning to validate the functionality.

I should mention the importance of continuous refinement. Since Scrum is iterative, functional analysis isn't a one-time activity. It happens continuously as the product backlog evolves and as the team gains more understanding of the product.

Also, tools like behavior-driven development (BDD) or acceptance test-driven development (ATDD) might be relevant here. These practices encourage defining acceptance criteria upfront, which is part of functional analysis.

Finally, I need to outline practical steps. For example, during backlog refinement, the team can break down user stories, define acceptance criteria, create tasks, and ensure everyone understands the functionality. In sprint planning, they can further analyze the selected stories to plan the work. Daily stand-ups can address any emerging questions about functionality, and sprint reviews can validate that the functionality meets the users' needs.

Wait, but I should make sure not to conflate functional analysis with other Scrum events. The key is to integrate functional analysis into existing Scrum ceremonies and artifacts without adding extra steps. Emphasize that it's part of the team's collaborative process during refinement and sprint planning.

Also, maybe mention that functional analysis in Scrum is about ensuring that each increment delivers the right functionality by continuously clarifying and validating requirements through collaboration and iterative development.
```

**Functional analysis in Scrum** involves breaking down product requirements into actionable, testable components to ensure the team delivers valuable, user-centric functionality. Here's how to integrate functional analysis into Scrum practices effectively:

---

### **1. Align with Scrum Roles & Events**
- **Product Owner (PO)**: Drives functional analysis by clarifying requirements and prioritizing the Product Backlog.
- **Development Team**: Collaborates to dissect user stories, define acceptance criteria, and identify technical tasks.
- **Scrum Events**: Conduct analysis during **Backlog Refinement**, **Sprint Planning**, and **Daily Scrum**.

---

### **2. Steps to Perform Functional Analysis in Scrum**
#### **A. During Backlog Refinement**  
1. **Break Down Epics/Features**:  
   - Split large requirements (epics) into smaller, testable **user stories** (e.g., "As a user, I can reset my password via email").  
   - Use **user story mapping** to visualize workflows and dependencies.  

2. **Define Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Specify conditions for a story to be "done" (e.g., "Password reset email is sent within 2 minutes").  
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to ensure clarity.  

3. **Identify Dependencies & Risks**:  
   - Highlight technical or functional dependencies (e.g., integration with an external API).  

#### **B. During Sprint Planning**  
4. **Select Stories for the Sprint**:  
   - Choose user stories aligned with the Sprint Goal and team capacity.  

5. **Decompose Stories into Tasks**:  
   - Break stories into technical tasks (e.g., "Implement email service for password reset").  
   - Use **example mapping** to explore edge cases (e.g., "What if the user enters an invalid email?").  

6. **Clarify Functional Details**:  
   - Resolve ambiguities through team discussion or **Three Amigos** sessions (PO, developer, tester).  

#### **C. During Sprint Execution**  
7. **Continuous Collaboration**:  
   - Use **Daily Scrum** to address emerging functional questions (e.g., "How should error messages display?").  
   - Pair programming or mob programming to align on implementation.  

8. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:  
   - Write automated tests based on acceptance criteria before coding to validate functionality.  

#### **D. During Sprint Review**  
9. **Demo Functionality**:  
   - Showcase the increment to stakeholders and validate it meets their functional expectations.  

10. **Gather Feedback**:  
   - Adjust the Product Backlog based on stakeholder input (e.g., "Add SMS as a password reset option").  

---

### **3. Tools & Techniques**  
- **User Story Mapping**: Visualize user journeys to prioritize and analyze functionality.  
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)**: Define acceptance criteria in a structured format (e.g., Gherkin syntax).  
- **Definition of Ready (DoR)**: Ensure stories are well-analyzed before sprint inclusion (e.g., "Acceptance criteria agreed").  
- **Traceability Matrix**: Link user stories to tests and requirements to ensure coverage.  

---

### **4. Example: Password Reset Feature**  
11. **User Story**:  
   - *"As a user, I can reset my password via email so I can regain access to my account."*  

12. **Acceptance Criteria**:  
   - Email is sent within 2 minutes of request.  
   - Link expires after 24 hours.  
   - System logs failed attempts.  

13. **Tasks**:  
   - Integrate email service (e.g., SendGrid).  
   - Implement token-based expiration.  
   - Write unit tests for token validation.  

---

### **5. Benefits of Functional Analysis in Scrum**  
- **Reduces Ambiguity**: Clear requirements minimize rework.  
- **Improves Quality**: Testable criteria ensure functionality aligns with user needs.  
- **Accelerates Delivery**: Smaller, well-understood stories enable faster iteration.  

---

### **6. Common Pitfalls & Solutions**  
| **Pitfall**                       | **Solution**                                      |  
|-----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|  
| Vague acceptance criteria         | Use BDD-style examples (Given/When/Then).         |  
| Overlooking edge cases            | Conduct example mapping with the Three Amigos.    |  
| Analysis paralysis                | Timebox refinement sessions (e.g., 1 hour/week). |  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
Functional analysis in Scrum is **not a phase**—it’s a **continuous, collaborative process** embedded in Scrum events. By breaking down requirements iteratively, defining clear acceptance criteria, and validating functionality early, teams deliver increments that truly meet user needs.

## Functional Requirements Review in Software Engineering
A **Functional Requirements Review (FRR)** in software engineering is a structured evaluation process where stakeholders assess and validate the documented functional requirements of a system to ensure they are **clear, complete, feasible, and aligned with user needs and business goals**. It is a critical checkpoint in the software development lifecycle (SDLC) to minimize misunderstandings, gaps, or errors before development begins.

---

### **Key Objectives of an FRR**
1. **Verify Completeness**: Ensure all user needs and system behaviors are captured.  
2. **Clarify Ambiguities**: Resolve vague or conflicting requirements (e.g., "The system shall process transactions quickly").  
3. **Validate Feasibility**: Confirm requirements are technically achievable within constraints (time, budget, technology).  
4. **Ensure Testability**: Define criteria that QA can validate (e.g., "User login must succeed within 2 seconds").  
5. **Align Stakeholders**: Get consensus among developers, testers, product owners, and end-users.  

---

### **Who Participates?**
- **Business Analysts/Product Owners**: Define and prioritize requirements.  
- **Developers**: Assess technical feasibility.  
- **QA/Test Engineers**: Ensure requirements are testable.  
- **End-Users/Clients**: Validate alignment with real-world needs.  
- **Project Managers**: Ensure requirements fit timelines and resources.  

---

### **Steps in a Functional Requirements Review**
1. **Preparation**:  
   - Gather requirements documents (e.g., Software Requirements Specification [SRS], user stories, use cases).  
   - Distribute materials to reviewers in advance.  

2. **Review Meeting**:  
   - Walk through each requirement line-by-line.  
   - Discuss ambiguities, contradictions, or missing details.  
   - Use checklists to ensure consistency and completeness.  

3. **Document Updates**:  
   - Revise requirements based on feedback (e.g., clarify vague terms like "user-friendly").  
   - Log unresolved issues for follow-up.  

4. **Sign-Off**:  
   - Formal approval from stakeholders to proceed to design/development.  

---

### **What to Evaluate During an FRR**
| **Aspect**                | **Key Questions**                                                                 |  
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Clarity**                | Is the requirement free of jargon and ambiguity? (e.g., "fast" vs. "response time <1s"). |  
| **Consistency**            | Do requirements conflict with each other or with non-functional requirements?      |  
| **Completeness**           | Are all user scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions covered?                 |  
| **Testability**            | Can QA design test cases to verify the requirement?                               |  
| **Traceability**           | Is the requirement linked to business goals or user stories?                     |  
| **Feasibility**            | Can this be implemented with current resources and technology?                   |  

---

### **Example Scenario**  
**Requirement**: *"Users can filter search results by price range."*  
**FRR Feedback**:  
- Ambiguity: What happens if no results match the price range?  
- Missing Edge Case: How are decimal values or currency conversions handled?  
- Testability: Add acceptance criteria like, "Display 'No results found' if filters return empty."  

---

### **Benefits of an FRR**
- **Reduces Rework**: Catch errors early to avoid costly fixes later.  
- **Improves Collaboration**: Aligns developers, testers, and business teams.  
- **Enhances Quality**: Clear requirements lead to fewer defects and better user satisfaction.  
- **Mitigates Risks**: Identifies gaps in security, scalability, or compliance early.  

---

### **Common Pitfalls & Solutions**  
| **Pitfall**                | **Solution**                                                                 |  
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Vague requirements          | Replace subjective terms (e.g., "fast") with measurable metrics.            |  
| Missing stakeholders        | Involve end-users, QA, and architects upfront.                              |  
| Overlooking edge cases      | Use techniques like *example mapping* to explore "what-if" scenarios.       |  
| Scope creep                 | Stick to a pre-defined agenda and defer out-of-scope ideas to future phases. |  

---

### **FRR in Agile/Scrum**  
In Agile teams, FRR is often integrated into:  
- **Backlog Refinement**: Breaking down epics into user stories with clear acceptance criteria.  
- **Sprint Planning**: Ensuring selected stories are well-defined and testable.  
- **Three Amigos Meetings**: Collaborative sessions (BA, developer, tester) to clarify requirements.  

---

### **Tools to Support FRR**  
- **Requirements Management Tools**: Jira, Confluence, IBM DOORS.  
- **Traceability Matrices**: Link requirements to tests, code, and business objectives.  
- **Checklists**: Standardize review criteria (e.g., "Is the requirement atomic?").  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
A Functional Requirements Review is **not a formality**—it’s a **strategic step** to ensure the software solves the right problem, in the right way. By rigorously validating requirements, teams avoid building the wrong features, reduce wasted effort, and deliver higher-value solutions.  

**Without an FRR**, you risk:  
- Building features users don’t need.  
- Costly mid-development requirement changes.  
- A final product that fails to meet business goals.


## how to conduct functional requirements review in Scrum
```code
Okay, the user is asking how to conduct a Functional Requirements Review (FRR) in Scrum. Let me start by recalling what I know about Scrum and FRRs.

Scrum is an Agile framework with roles like Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. FRR is a process where stakeholders review functional requirements to ensure they're clear, complete, and feasible. But in Scrum, the terminology might be a bit different. Instead of traditional "requirements," they use Product Backlog Items (PBIs) like user stories.

The user probably wants to integrate FRR into Scrum events without disrupting the Agile flow. They might be a Scrum team member trying to ensure their user stories are well-defined before development. Common challenges here could be vague acceptance criteria or misalignment between stakeholders.

I need to explain how FRR fits into Scrum ceremonies. Let's break down the Scrum events where FRR can be incorporated. Backlog Refinement is key here. Also, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and maybe even Daily Standups. The Three Amigos technique (BA, developer, tester) could be useful.

I should outline steps for each Scrum event. For example, during Backlog Refinement, the team can review user stories, clarify acceptance criteria, and identify gaps. In Sprint Planning, they ensure selected items are ready. In the Sprint, continuous collaboration happens.

Also, the user might need practical examples, like a sample user story with acceptance criteria before and after FRR. Including best practices and common pitfalls would help them avoid mistakes. Tools like Jira or Confluence could be mentioned for tracking.

I need to make sure the answer is structured, easy to follow, and actionable. Highlighting the roles involved and how they collaborate is important. Emphasize that FRR in Scrum is iterative and integrated into the process rather than a separate phase.

Let me check if there's anything I'm missing. Oh, maybe mention the Definition of Ready (DoR) as part of ensuring PBIs are review-complete. Also, how to handle feedback from Sprint Reviews to update the backlog.

Alright, structuring the answer with sections for each Scrum event, roles, examples, best practices, and tools should cover it. Keep it conversational but informative.
```
Conducting a **Functional Requirements Review (FRR)** in **Scrum** requires integrating the review process into Agile ceremonies and collaboration frameworks. Here’s how to do it effectively without disrupting the Scrum flow:

---

### **1. Align FRR with Scrum Events**
In Scrum, functional requirements are captured as **Product Backlog Items (PBIs)** like user stories, epics, or features. FRR is not a standalone phase but a continuous, collaborative effort embedded in:

#### **A. Backlog Refinement (Grooming)**  
- **When**: Ongoing (ideally 1-2 times per sprint).  
- **Goal**: Ensure PBIs are **clear**, **testable**, and **ready** for sprint planning.  
- **Activities**:  
  - Break down epics into smaller user stories.  
  - Define **acceptance criteria** with the Three Amigos (Product Owner, Developer, Tester).  
  - Identify gaps (e.g., missing edge cases, unclear workflows).  
  - Use **example mapping** to explore scenarios (Given/When/Then).  

**Example**:  
- **User Story**: *"As a user, I can filter products by price range."*  
- **Refinement Session**:  
  - Clarify: *"What’s the minimum/maximum price range?"*  
  - Add acceptance criteria: *"Display ‘No results’ if no products match the filter."*  

---

#### **B. Sprint Planning**  
- **When**: Start of each sprint.  
- **Goal**: Confirm selected PBIs are **well-understood** and **actionable**.  
- **Activities**:  
  - Review acceptance criteria for sprint-ready PBIs.  
  - Flag ambiguities (e.g., *"How should the system handle decimal prices?"*).  
  - Split stories into tasks (e.g., *"Implement price filter UI component"*).  

---

#### **C. Daily Scrum**  
- **When**: Daily 15-minute standup.  
- **Goal**: Address emerging functional questions during sprint execution.  
- **Activities**:  
  - Developers/QA raise clarifications (e.g., *"How should error messages display for invalid filters?"*).  
  - Update acceptance criteria if needed.  

---

#### **D. Sprint Review**  
- **When**: End of each sprint.  
- **Goal**: Validate delivered functionality against requirements.  
- **Activities**:  
  - Demo the increment to stakeholders.  
  - Gather feedback to refine/update PBIs (e.g., *"Add a ‘reset filters’ button"*).  

---

### **2. Roles & Responsibilities**  
| **Role**                | **FRR Contribution**                                                                 |  
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Product Owner**        | Clarifies business goals, prioritizes PBIs, and defines "why" a feature is needed.   |  
| **Development Team**     | Assesses technical feasibility and breaks down requirements into tasks.              |  
| **QA/Testers**           | Ensures acceptance criteria are testable and covers edge cases.                      |  
| **Scrum Master**         | Facilitates collaboration and removes blockers during refinement.                    |  

---

### **3. Key Practices for FRR in Scrum**  
#### **A. Use the "Definition of Ready" (DoR)**  
Define a checklist for PBIs to be considered **ready** for sprint planning:  
- Acceptance criteria are clear and testable.  
- Dependencies are identified.  
- UX/UI mockups are available (if applicable).  

#### **B. Three Amigos Collaboration**  
Hold informal sessions with **Product Owner**, **Developer**, and **Tester** to:  
- Clarify requirements.  
- Explore edge cases.  
- Write acceptance criteria in BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) format:  
  ```gherkin  
  Scenario: Filter products by price  
    Given a user is on the product page  
    When they set the price range to $50-$100  
    Then only products within $50-$100 are displayed  
  ```  

#### **C. Automate Requirements Traceability**  
Use tools like **Jira** or **Azure DevOps** to link PBIs to:  
- Acceptance criteria.  
- Test cases.  
- Code commits.  

---

### **4. Example Workflow**  
1. **Backlog Refinement**:  
   - PO presents a user story: *"As a user, I can save items to a wishlist."*  
   - Team asks:  
     - *"How many items can be saved?"*  
     - *"Can users share wishlists?"*  
   - Updated story:  
     - Acceptance criteria: *"Wishlist supports up to 100 items. Sharing is Phase 2."*  

2. **Sprint Planning**:  
   - Team selects the refined story for the sprint.  
   - Tasks created: *"Design wishlist UI," "Implement backend storage."*  

3. **Sprint Execution**:  
   - Daily Scrum: QA asks, *"How are duplicate items handled?"* → Answer: *"Show a warning."*  

4. **Sprint Review**:  
   - Demo wishlist functionality.  
   - Stakeholder feedback: *"Add a ‘move to cart’ button."* → New PBI added.  

---

### **5. Tools to Support FRR in Scrum**  
- **Jira/Confluence**: Track PBIs, acceptance criteria, and decisions.  
- **BDD Tools** (e.g., Cucumber): Automate test scenarios based on acceptance criteria.  
- **Miro/Mural**: Visual collaboration for example mapping or user story mapping.

### **6. Common Pitfalls & Solutions**  
| **Pitfall**                     | **Solution**                                                                 |  
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Vague acceptance criteria        | Use BDD-style examples (Given/When/Then).                                   |  
| Overlooking non-functional needs | Pair FRR with non-functional reviews (e.g., performance, security).         |  
| Siloed reviews                   | Involve the whole Scrum Team (devs, QA, PO) in refinement.                  |

### **Key Takeaway**  
In Scrum, **Functional Requirements Review** is **not a one-time event** but a **continuous, collaborative process** woven into:  
- Backlog refinement to clarify PBIs.  
- Sprint planning to confirm readiness.  
- Daily scrums to resolve ambiguities.  
- Sprint reviews to validate outcomes.  

By integrating FRR into Scrum rituals, teams ensure they build the **right features**, with **clear expectations**, and **minimize rework**. The goal is to foster a culture where **shared understanding** drives quality.
