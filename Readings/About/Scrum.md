## The Daily Scrum and Empiricism

-- from # 18 Paragraphs That Will Make Your Daily Scrum Better[https://turboscrum.com/better-daily-scrum/#more-3858]  

You may recall that Scrum is founded on empirical process control. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known.

The pillars of empiricism are transparency, inspection and adaptation. Every event in Scrum is a formal opportunity for inspection and adaptation and the Scrum Guide makes it very clear what is inspected and adapted in the Daily Scrum:

> The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
