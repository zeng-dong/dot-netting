### The Quality Equation

a powerful concept that helps us balance the value we deliver to users with the cost of development

The key lies in maximizing the value for the cost of the product or feature. 
If you focus on delivering features and functionalities that truly matter to users, you can maximize value while keeping development costs under control. 

The quality equation highlights the cost effectiveness of proactive quality measures. 

The quality equation reminds us that there is a tipping point. While striving for excellence is important, obsessing over every tiny detail can be counterproductive. 

Imagine going on a long hike. You need to balance between traveling light versus bringing everything you need because you would get bogged down by carrying an excessive amount of weight. 

You should focus on features and functionalities that deliver real value to users, but avoid getting hung up on excessive perfectionism or features that add little value.

# the legacy of 255

## why is it popular

```
Okay, so the user is asking why 255 is a popular max length for database columns. Let me start by recalling what I know about databases and data types.

First, I remember that in many databases, like MySQL, VARCHAR uses a byte to store the length of the string. So if the length is up to 255, it uses 1 byte. If it's more, like 256 or higher, it requires 2 bytes. That extra byte might not seem like a big deal, but maybe in the past when storage was more limited, saving that byte was important for efficiency. So that's one point about storage optimization.

Then there's the historical context. Early database systems might have had limitations that made 255 a practical choice. Maybe older versions of MySQL or other databases had this 255 limit because of how they handled VARCHAR. Even if newer versions allow longer lengths, people stick with 255 out of habit or for backward compatibility. That makes sense as a reason for its continued popularity.

Another thing is indexing. Indexes in databases have limits on the length of columns they can cover. For example, InnoDB in MySQL has a limit of 767 bytes per index entry. If using a UTF-8 character set where each character can take up to 3 bytes, 255 characters would be 765 bytes, which is under the 767 limit. So using 255 allows the entire column to be indexed without hitting that ceiling. That's a good point about indexes and performance.

Also, application frameworks like Ruby on Rails might default to 255 for string fields. Developers following conventions would use this unless they need more, leading to widespread adoption. It's easier to stick with defaults unless there's a specific need, so that contributes to the popularity.

There's also the psychological aspect. 255 is a round number in computing because it's 2^8 - 1, the maximum value for an 8-bit unsigned integer. People recognize it as a common max value, so using it as a length feels natural. Plus, it's a reasonable default that's long enough for most use cases like names, emails, etc., without being excessive.

But wait, are there any downsides? If a field actually needs more than 255, using 255 would be restrictive. However, in many cases, 255 is sufficient, so it's a safe default. Also, with modern storage, the 1 byte saving isn't as crucial, but old habits and existing schemas might still use 255.

Let me check if there are other reasons. Maybe compatibility with legacy systems or certain data formats that use 255 as a limit. Or perhaps some network protocols or file formats that historically used 255, influencing database design. But I think the main points are storage efficiency, index limits, framework defaults, and historical reasons.

So summarizing, the key factors are: 1-byte length prefix storage, historical database limitations, index size constraints, framework conventions, and the psychological comfort with a known binary round number. These combined make 255 a popular choice even if the technical necessity has diminished over time.
```
The use of **255** as a common maximum length for database columns (e.g., `VARCHAR(255)`) stems from a mix of historical, technical, and practical considerations:

### 1. **Storage Efficiency (1-Byte Length Prefix)**
   - In databases like **MySQL**, the `VARCHAR` type uses **1 byte** to store the length of the string if the declared length is **≤ 255**. For lengths **≥ 256**, it requires **2 bytes** to store the length.  
   - Example: `VARCHAR(255)` uses 1 byte for metadata, while `VARCHAR(256)` uses 2 bytes. This optimization mattered more in older systems with limited storage.

### 2. **Historical Database Limits**
   - Early versions of MySQL restricted `VARCHAR` columns to **255 bytes** (pre-5.0.3). While modern databases support much larger lengths (e.g., 65,535+), legacy systems and habits perpetuated the use of 255.
   - Tools and ORMs (e.g., Ruby on Rails) historically defaulted to `VARCHAR(255)` for strings, reinforcing its adoption.

### 3. **Indexing Constraints**
   - Database indexes have size limits. For example:
     - MySQL's InnoDB engine allowed **767 bytes per index entry** (prior to `innodb_large_prefix`). Using UTF-8 (3 bytes per character), **255 characters × 3 bytes = 765 bytes**, fitting under the limit.
   - Exceeding this would prevent full-column indexing or require prefix indexing, reducing query efficiency.

### 4. **Convention Over Configuration**
   - Developers often default to 255 as a "safe" length for common fields (names, emails, etc.) unless a longer value is explicitly needed. It balances flexibility and storage.

### 5. **Binary Round Number (2^8 – 1)**
   - **255** is the maximum value of an **8-bit unsigned integer** (2⁸ – 1), making it a natural "max" in computing contexts (e.g., RGB color values, old network protocols).

### 6. **Legacy System Compatibility**
   - Older file formats (e.g., **dBase**) or protocols (e.g., **SMTP**) used 255-character limits, influencing database design patterns.

### Modern Relevance
While modern databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL 5.0.3+) support much larger `VARCHAR` lengths, **255** persists due to:
- **Backward compatibility** with existing schemas.
- **Preventing over-allocation** (e.g., a `VARCHAR(255)` allocates only the space needed for the actual data, unlike `CHAR`).
- **Habit and convention** in frameworks and developer workflows.

### When to Avoid 255
- For fields requiring longer values (e.g., URLs, JSON blobs), use `TEXT` or larger `VARCHAR` limits.
- When indexing full-text content, use dedicated `FULLTEXT` indexes instead.

In summary, **255** is a relic of early database optimization and indexing constraints, but its practicality ensures it remains a popular default.

## is it a standard
The use of **255** as a length for string-type database columns (e.g., `VARCHAR(255)`) is a **common convention**, but **not an official industry standard**. Here’s a breakdown of why it’s widespread and when it’s (in)appropriate:

---

### **Why 255 is Common**
1. **Historical Optimization**:
   - In older MySQL versions, `VARCHAR(255)` used **1 byte** to store the string length (for values ≤255), while longer strings required 2 bytes. This made 255 a storage-efficient choice.
   - Legacy systems and habits perpetuated this practice even after technical constraints were lifted.

2. **Indexing Limits**:
   - Some databases (e.g., MySQL’s InnoDB) had index entry size limits (e.g., 767 bytes). With UTF-8 (3 bytes per character), **255 characters × 3 ≈ 765 bytes**, fitting neatly under the limit.

3. **Framework Defaults**:
   - Tools like Ruby on Rails historically used `VARCHAR(255)` as a default for string columns, reinforcing its adoption.

4. **Binary Convenience**:
   - 255 is the maximum value of an 8-bit unsigned integer (`2^8 – 1`), making it a natural "max" in computing contexts (e.g., RGB colors).

---

### **Why It’s Not an Industry Standard**
1. **Database Variability**:
   - **Oracle**: Requires explicit lengths (no default) and allows up to `VARCHAR2(4000)` or `32767` bytes in extended mode.
   - **SQL Server**: Defaults to `VARCHAR(1)` if no length is specified (not 255!).
   - **PostgreSQL**: Supports `VARCHAR(n)` but defaults to unlimited-length `TEXT` if no length is specified.

2. **Modern Best Practices**:
   - **Data-Driven Sizing**: Column lengths should reflect actual data requirements (e.g., `VARCHAR(320)` for email addresses, `VARCHAR(100)` for names).
   - **Avoid Arbitrary Limits**: Using 255 for fields like URLs (which can exceed 255 characters) risks truncation. Modern systems often use `VARCHAR(MAX)` or `TEXT` for such cases.
   - **UTF-8 Overhead**: In multi-byte character sets (e.g., emojis), 255 characters might exceed storage or indexing limits.

3. **Performance Trade-offs**:
   - Overestimating lengths (e.g., `VARCHAR(255)` for a 10-character field) doesn’t waste storage (since `VARCHAR` is variable-length), but it can lead to **query plan inefficiencies** or **index bloat** if indexed.

---

### **When to Use 255**
- **Short, Predictable Fields**: Names, codes, or labels with known limits (e.g., ISO country codes).
- **Legacy Systems**: When migrating older schemas or working with tools that assume 255.
- **Temporary or Non-Critical Data**: For prototyping or non-production environments.

---

### **When to Avoid 255**
- **Long or Unbounded Data**: Use `VARCHAR(MAX)` (SQL Server), `TEXT` (PostgreSQL), or `CLOB` (Oracle) for large text.
- **Multi-Byte Characters**: For languages like Chinese or emoji-heavy text, 255 *characters* may require far more than 255 *bytes*.
- **Unique Constraints/Indexes**: Oversized indexed columns waste space and slow performance.

---

### **Modern Alternatives**
1. **Domain-Specific Sizing**:
   - Email: `VARCHAR(320)` (max email length).
   - URLs: `VARCHAR(2048)` or `VARCHAR(MAX)`.
   - UUIDs: `CHAR(36)`.

2. **Dynamic Lengths**:
   - Use `VARCHAR(MAX)`/`TEXT` when flexibility is critical.

3. **Validation Layers**:
   - Enforce length limits at the application level, not just the database.

---

### **Conclusion**
While **255** is a historical convention rooted in older database optimizations, it is **not an industry standard**. Modern database design prioritizes **data requirements** over arbitrary defaults. Always:
- Define lengths based on actual use cases.
- Consider character encoding and indexing needs.
- Use appropriate types (e.g., `TEXT`, `VARCHAR(MAX)`) for large or variable data.


# ask deepseek about judgemental call is DoD
should "Definition of Done" contain some subjective judgmental calls

Thought for 18 seconds

Okay, so the user is asking whether the "Definition of Done" (DoD) should include some subjective judgment calls. Let me start by recalling what the DoD is. From what I know, in Agile methodologies like Scrum, the DoD is a set of criteria that a product increment must meet to be considered complete. It's supposed to be a clear and shared understanding among the team.

Now, the question is about whether there's room for subjectivity in that. My first thought is that ideally, the DoD should be as objective as possible to avoid ambiguity. If it's subjective, different team members might interpret it differently, leading to inconsistencies. For example, if a DoD item is "Code is well-tested," that's pretty vague. What does "well-tested" mean? One developer might think unit tests are enough, another might think integration tests are necessary. That could cause problems in quality or delays.

But maybe there are areas where some subjectivity is unavoidable. Let's say a team includes a requirement like "User interface is intuitive." Intuitiveness is subjective by nature. It's based on user perception, which can vary. So in such cases, how does the team handle that? They might need to rely on user testing or expert reviews, which introduces some judgment but based on feedback rather than personal opinion.

Another angle is the maturity of the team. Newer teams might have a less refined DoD that includes more subjective measures because they're still learning. Over time, as they gain experience, they can replace those subjective items with more objective ones. For instance, instead of saying "Code is clean," they might adopt specific coding standards or use static analysis tools to measure code quality.

Also, different contexts might require different approaches. In creative fields like design or content creation, some subjectivity is inherent. A DoD for a design task might include "Approved by the client," which is a subjective judgment but necessary. However, even there, teams can aim to make the approval criteria as clear as possible to reduce ambiguity.

I should also consider the balance between flexibility and rigor. Too much subjectivity might lead to scope creep or incomplete work, but too much rigidity could stifle creativity or adaptability. The key is finding a middle ground where the DoD is mostly objective but allows for expert judgment in areas where it's needed.

Examples might help. If the DoD includes "All tests pass," that's objective. If it includes "Code reviewed by two peers," that's also objective. But if it includes "User story meets acceptance criteria," and the acceptance criteria are vague, then it's subjective. So the solution is to make sure acceptance criteria are well-defined.

In conclusion, while the DoD should primarily be objective to ensure consistency and clarity, there might be scenarios where some subjectivity is necessary. However, teams should strive to minimize it by defining clear, measurable criteria wherever possible and using agreed-upon processes (like user testing or expert review) to handle areas where subjectivity can't be eliminated entirely.

The **Definition of Done (DoD)** should ideally minimize subjectivity to ensure consistency, transparency, and shared understanding within a team. However, in practice, some judgment may be unavoidable depending on context. Here's a breakdown:

### **1. Objective Criteria Are Preferred**

- **Clarity and Consistency**: Objective criteria (e.g., "All unit tests pass," "Code reviewed by two peers") reduce ambiguity and ensure everyone agrees on what "done" means. This prevents disagreements and uneven quality.
    
- **Measurability**: Metrics like test coverage percentages, compliance with coding standards, or automated checks leave little room for interpretation.
    

### **2. When Subjectivity _Might_ Creep In**

- **Design/Creative Work**: Criteria like "UI aligns with brand guidelines" or "user-friendly" may require expert judgment. Teams can mitigate this by referencing style guides, user testing, or stakeholder sign-offs.
    
- **Complex or Novel Problems**: Early-stage projects might lack clear benchmarks, requiring experienced team members to assess readiness (e.g., "solution is scalable enough for MVP").
    
- **Cultural Norms**: Teams may implicitly rely on shared standards (e.g., "clean code"), but these should evolve into explicit, measurable rules over time.
    

### **3. Mitigating Subjectivity**

- **Refine the DoD Iteratively**: Replace vague terms (e.g., "well-tested") with specifics (e.g., "80% test coverage, integration tests included").
    
- **Use Guardrails for Judgment**: If subjective criteria are unavoidable, define _who_ decides (e.g., "approved by UX lead") or _how_ (e.g., "validated via user testing with 5+ participants").
    
- **Balance Flexibility and Rigor**: In creative fields, pair subjective goals (e.g., "client approves") with objective checks (e.g., "meets accessibility standards").
    

### **4. Risks of Excessive Subjectivity**

- Inconsistent quality, scope creep, or delays if team members interpret criteria differently.
    
- Erosion of trust if stakeholders perceive the DoD as arbitrary.
    

### **Conclusion**

Aim for **objectivity first**, but acknowledge that **some judgment may be necessary** in nuanced scenarios. Teams should document and refine the DoD collaboratively to minimize ambiguity while allowing flexibility where expertise is required. Over time, replace subjective elements with measurable standards as the team matures.


## asked copilot
The "Definition of Done" (DoD) is a critical concept in Agile development, ensuring that all the criteria are met for a feature or task before it can be considered complete. Ideally, the DoD should be as objective and quantifiable as possible to avoid ambiguity. However, there might be some scenarios where subjective judgmental calls are necessary. Here's a breakdown of when it might be appropriate:

### When to Include Subjective Judgmental Calls:
- **Quality Assurance**: Certain quality aspects like user experience or design aesthetics may require a subjective assessment to ensure they meet the desired standards.
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: When gathering feedback from stakeholders or end-users, some subjective judgment may be necessary to interpret and act on their input.
- **Innovative Features**: For innovative or creative features, it might be challenging to define objective criteria. In such cases, subjective judgment can help gauge whether the feature meets its intended goals.

### When to Avoid Subjective Judgmental Calls:
- **Technical Completion**: Tasks like code implementation, unit tests, or documentation should have clear, objective criteria to avoid discrepancies.
- **Compliance and Regulations**: Any criteria related to legal, regulatory, or compliance requirements must be strictly objective to ensure adherence.

Ultimately, while the core of the DoD should be objective, including some subjective elements can be valuable for ensuring quality and user satisfaction. It’s about finding the right balance to meet your project's specific needs.

Do you have any particular examples or scenarios in mind where you're considering incorporating subjective judgment into your DoD? It might help to discuss those specific cases!





## why scrum define dod

<thought>
Okay, the user is asking why Scrum defines the Definition of Done. Let me start by recalling what the Definition of Done (DoD) is in Scrum. From previous conversations, I know that the DoD is a set of criteria that a product increment must meet to be considered complete. But why does Scrum emphasize this?

First, I should think about the core principles of Scrum. Scrum is all about iterative development, transparency, inspection, and adaptation. The DoD plays a role in ensuring that each increment is potentially shippable. Without a clear DoD, teams might have different understandings of what "done" means, leading to inconsistencies and quality issues.

The user might be coming from a scenario where their team has faced issues with incomplete work or miscommunication. They might want to understand the underlying reasons Scrum insists on the DoD to better implement it in their own processes.

I should break down the main reasons Scrum defines the DoD. Transparency is a big one. The DoD makes the standards explicit so everyone knows what's expected. Quality assurance is another; by having a checklist, teams ensure they don't skip crucial steps like testing or documentation.

Also, the DoD helps in managing stakeholder expectations. If everyone agrees on what done means, there's less room for disagreement later. It also supports continuous improvement because the team can refine the DoD as they learn more about their process.

I need to make sure to mention how the DoD contributes to the Scrum pillars: transparency, inspection, and adaptation. Maybe give examples of what a DoD might include, like code reviews, testing, documentation. Also, highlight that the DoD is agreed upon by the whole team, which fosters collective ownership.

I should also address potential misconceptions. Some might think the DoD is too rigid, but in reality, it's meant to evolve. The team updates it as they improve. Also, it's not just for developers; stakeholders benefit from knowing the work meets certain standards.

Finally, summarize the key points to reinforce why Scrum includes the DoD. It's all about ensuring quality, alignment, and continuous improvement. Maybe end with a note on how teams can start defining their DoD if they haven't already.
</thought>


Scrum defines a **Definition of Done (DoD)** to ensure clarity, consistency, and quality in delivering increments of work. The DoD acts as a shared agreement within the Scrum Team (and with stakeholders) about what it means for a product backlog item to be truly "done." Here’s why Scrum emphasizes this concept:

---

### **1. Ensures Transparency**  
   - The DoD eliminates ambiguity about what "done" means, ensuring everyone (developers, Product Owner, stakeholders) has the same expectations.  
   - Without a DoD, teams risk delivering incomplete or inconsistent work, leading to confusion and technical debt.

---

### **2. Guarantees Quality**  
   - The DoD enforces a baseline of quality by defining non-negotiable criteria (e.g., "code reviewed," "tested," "documented").  
   - It prevents teams from cutting corners (e.g., skipping testing or documentation) to meet deadlines.

---

### **3. Supports Incremental Delivery**  
   - Scrum requires a **potentially shippable increment** at the end of each Sprint. The DoD ensures every increment meets the team’s quality standards.  
   - Without a DoD, increments might lack essential elements (e.g., missing user acceptance tests), making them unusable.

---

### **4. Facilitates Continuous Improvement**  
   - The DoD is not static. Teams regularly refine it during Sprint Retrospectives to address gaps (e.g., adding security scans or performance benchmarks).  
   - This fosters a culture of learning and adaptation.

---

### **5. Reduces Risk**  
   - By explicitly defining completion criteria, the DoD minimizes the risk of hidden work or surprises (e.g., untested code or unresolved bugs).  
   - Stakeholders gain confidence that deliverables meet agreed standards.

---

### **6. Aligns the Team**  
   - The DoD creates a shared understanding of responsibilities. For example, it clarifies whether tasks like UX reviews or DevOps deployments are part of the team’s workflow.  
   - It prevents the "90% done" fallacy (where work is declared "done" prematurely).

---

### **What’s Typically Included in a DoD?**  
While the specifics vary by team, a DoD often includes criteria like:  
- Code reviewed and merged.  
- Automated tests passing.  
- Documentation updated.  
- Performance benchmarks met.  
- Stakeholder/UAT approval.  
- Deployed to a staging environment.  

---

### **Example Scenario**  
Imagine a team *without* a DoD:  
- A developer marks a feature "done" after writing code but skips testing.  
- The Product Owner expects the feature to be fully tested and deployable.  
- Misalignment leads to delays and frustration.  

With a DoD:  
- The team agrees that "done" means code is reviewed, tested, documented, and deployed to staging.  
- Everyone knows the standards upfront, reducing conflicts.

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
The **Definition of Done** is foundational to Scrum because it:  
1. **Standardizes quality** across the product.  
2. **Builds trust** with stakeholders.  
3. **Enables predictability** in delivery.  
4. **Empowers teams** to own their process.  

If a team skips the DoD, they risk technical debt, miscommunication, and inconsistent outcomes. Scrum formalizes the DoD to ensure work is truly *done*—not just *developed*.



## dod is on incremental
In Scrum, the **Definition of Done (DoD)** is **defined at the Increment level**, not at the individual Product Backlog Item (PBI) level. However, PBIs (e.g., user stories, features) often have their own **acceptance criteria**, which complement the DoD. Here’s how they work together:

---

### **1. Definition of Done (DoD) Applies to the Increment**
   - The DoD is a **team-wide agreement** that defines the quality standards and completeness criteria for the **entire Increment** (the sum of all PBIs completed in a Sprint).  
   - **Example DoD Criteria**:  
     - Code reviewed and merged.  
     - All automated tests pass.  
     - Documentation updated.  
     - Deployed to staging.  
     - Performance benchmarks met.  
   - **Purpose**: Ensures every Increment is **potentially shippable** and meets a consistent quality baseline.

---

### **2. PBIs Have Acceptance Criteria**
   - **Acceptance Criteria** are specific, granular conditions that a **single PBI** must satisfy to be considered "done" from a functional perspective.  
   - **Example Acceptance Criteria for a PBI**:  
     - "User can reset their password via email."  
     - "Search results load within 2 seconds."  
   - **Purpose**: Defines **what** the PBI must achieve (scope and functionality).

---

### **Key Differences**
| **Definition of Done** | **Acceptance Criteria** |  
|-------------------------|--------------------------|  
| Applies to the **entire Increment**. | Applies to **individual PBIs**. |  
| Focuses on **technical and quality standards**. | Focuses on **functional requirements**. |  
| Consistent across all PBIs in a Sprint. | Unique to each PBI. |  

---

### **Why the DoD Isn’t Defined per PBI**
   - **Consistency**: The DoD ensures all work in the Increment meets the same quality bar, regardless of the PBI.  
   - **Predictability**: Teams can reliably forecast how much they can deliver in a Sprint because the DoD’s scope is fixed.  
   - **Avoids Duplication**: If the DoD were defined per PBI, teams would waste time redefining standards for every item.  

---

### **How They Work Together**  
For a PBI to be included in the Increment:  
1. It must meet its **acceptance criteria** (functional completeness).  
2. The work to deliver it must satisfy the **DoD** (technical completeness).  

**Example**:  
- A user story (PBI) for a login feature might have acceptance criteria like:  
  - "User can log in with email and password."  
  - "Error message displays for invalid credentials."  
- To meet the DoD, the team must also:  
  - Write unit tests for the login feature.  
  - Ensure accessibility standards are met.  
  - Deploy the code to a staging environment.  

---

### **Risks of Confusing DoD with PBI Acceptance Criteria**
   - **Inconsistent Quality**: PBIs might meet functional needs but lack technical rigor (e.g., untested code).  
   - **Scope Creep**: Teams might treat the DoD as optional for individual PBIs, leading to incomplete work.  
   - **Misalignment**: Stakeholders might assume a "done" PBI is shippable, only to discover technical debt later.  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
- **DoD**: A **non-negotiable checklist** for the **Increment** (applies to all PBIs).  
- **Acceptance Criteria**: A **custom checklist** for **individual PBIs** (defines functionality).  
- Both are essential: The DoD ensures technical quality, while acceptance criteria ensure the right functionality is built.  

By separating these concepts, Scrum teams maintain both **functional correctness** and **technical integrity** in their deliverables.


**Functional requirements** in software engineering define **what a system should do**—the specific behaviors, features, and functions it must perform to meet user and stakeholder needs. They describe the system’s intended capabilities, inputs, outputs, and interactions in detail. Here’s a breakdown:

## should a software compliant to iso 25010 by law?

```code
Okay, the user is asking whether software must comply with ISO 25010 by law. Let me start by recalling what ISO 25010 is. It's a standard for software quality, outlining various attributes like functionality, reliability, usability, etc. Now, the question is about legal compliance.

First, I need to check if ISO 25010 itself is a legally mandated standard. Generally, ISO standards are voluntary unless referenced by laws or regulations. So, the answer likely depends on the industry or country. For example, medical devices or aviation software might have specific regulations that require certain standards, but does ISO 25010 specifically get cited in laws?

Next, consider regions like the EU. They have regulations like GDPR for data protection, but GDPR doesn't mention ISO 25010. However, some industries might use ISO standards as a benchmark for compliance. For instance, automotive with ISO 26262 for safety. Maybe in some cases, ISO 25010 is used as a guideline to meet legal requirements but isn't a law itself.

Also, the user might be conflating standards with legal requirements. It's possible they're in a situation where their software needs to meet certain quality metrics, and they're wondering if ISO 25010 is a legal necessity. The answer would clarify that it's not inherently required by law but could be part of contractual obligations or industry best practices.

I should structure the response by stating that ISO 25010 compliance isn't a legal requirement universally but might be referenced in specific contexts. Then, explain scenarios where it's required, like contracts or certain regulated industries, and provide examples. Also, mention the benefits of voluntary compliance even if not legally required.

Need to make sure the answer is clear, avoids technical jargon, and addresses both the legal aspect and practical implications. The user might be a developer or project manager looking to understand compliance needs, so the response should guide them on when and why ISO 25010 matters legally or otherwise.
```


Compliance with **ISO/IEC 25010** (the international standard for software quality) is **not universally required by law**. However, its adoption may become **indirectly mandatory** depending on the industry, region, or contractual obligations. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. ISO 25010 is a Guideline, Not a Law**
- ISO standards are **voluntary** unless explicitly referenced in legal regulations or contracts.  
- ISO 25010 defines software quality attributes (e.g., reliability, security, usability) but does not enforce compliance.  

---

### **2. When Compliance Might Be Legally Required**  
#### **A. Regulated Industries**  
Certain sectors have laws or regulations that implicitly require adherence to quality standards like ISO 25010:  
- **Healthcare**: Software for medical devices (e.g., FDA regulations in the U.S. or EU MDR) may demand rigorous quality benchmarks aligned with ISO 25010.  
- **Aviation**: DO-178C for airborne systems emphasizes reliability and safety, overlapping with ISO 25010 principles.  
- **Automotive**: ISO 26262 (functional safety) may align with ISO 25010’s reliability and security criteria.  

#### **B. Government or Public Sector Contracts**  
- Governments (e.g., EU, U.S.) may mandate ISO-compliant quality practices in public procurement contracts.  
- Example: A government healthcare portal might require ISO 25010-aligned usability and security.  

#### **C. Data Privacy Laws**  
- Regulations like **GDPR** (EU) or **CCPA** (California) require software to meet security and reliability standards. While they don’t cite ISO 25010 directly, compliance with its security criteria (e.g., data protection) helps meet legal obligations.  

---

### **3. When Compliance is Contractually Required**  
- Clients or partners may stipulate ISO 25010 compliance in **service-level agreements (SLAs)** or procurement contracts.  
- Example: A financial institution outsourcing software development might require ISO 25010 adherence for reliability and maintainability.  

---

### **4. Benefits of Voluntary Compliance**  
Even if not legally mandated, adopting ISO 25010:  
- Reduces legal risks by aligning with industry best practices.  
- Enhances credibility for audits, certifications (e.g., ISO 9001), or tenders.  
- Improves software quality, user satisfaction, and market competitiveness.  

---

### **5. How to Determine Legal Requirements**  
1. **Industry-Specific Laws**: Check regulations in your sector (e.g., HIPAA for healthcare, IEC 62304 for medical software).  
2. **Regional Laws**: Research local standards (e.g., EU’s Radio Equipment Directive for cybersecurity).  
3. **Contracts**: Review SLAs or partnership agreements for ISO 25010 references.  

---

### **Example Scenarios**  
| **Scenario**                          | **ISO 25010 Compliance Required?** |

| Developing a mobile game app          | No (unless contractually specified). |  
| Building a medical device in the EU   | Indirectly (via EU MDR alignment).  |  
| Government e-voting system contract   | Likely (via contractual terms).     |  
| GDPR-compliant CRM software           | Not directly, but security criteria may overlap. |

### **Key Takeaway**  
- **Not a universal law**: ISO 25010 compliance is not inherently required by law.  
- **Context-dependent**: It may become mandatory in regulated industries, government contracts, or specific legal frameworks.  
- **Best practice**: Aligning with ISO 25010 helps meet legal obligations (e.g., security, reliability) and reduces compliance risks.  

Always consult legal experts or regulatory bodies in your industry and region to confirm requirements.

## are QAs standards setters
```code
Okay, the user asked, "are QAs standards setters?" Let me break this down.

First, I need to understand what they mean by "standards setters." QA stands for Quality Assurance, right? So the question is whether QA professionals set standards in software development.

Well, in many organizations, QA teams are responsible for ensuring that products meet certain quality criteria. But does that mean they set the standards? Maybe not unilaterally. Standards often come from industry regulations, company policies, or client requirements. QA's role might be more about enforcing these standards rather than creating them.

But wait, sometimes QA teams do contribute to defining internal standards. For example, they might establish testing protocols or define what "done" means for a project. So maybe in some contexts, QAs do set standards, especially if there's no existing framework.

Also, I should consider different environments. In a startup, QA might have more influence in setting standards because processes are still being developed. In a large corporation, standards might be set by a separate governance body, and QA enforces them.

Another angle: collaboration. QA works with developers, product managers, and stakeholders. So while they might not set standards alone, they collaborate to define quality benchmarks. Their input is crucial in shaping those standards based on testing outcomes and defect trends.

But there's a difference between setting and maintaining standards. QA might maintain standards by ensuring compliance, but the initial setting could involve multiple teams. Maybe the user is conflating setting vs. enforcing.

I should also think about industry standards like ISO or IEEE. QA teams ensure compliance with these, but they don't set them. Those are external standards. So QA's role is to adhere to and enforce these, not create them.

However, internal processes like test case design, automation frameworks, or defect classification could be areas where QA sets internal standards. So it's a mix. The answer probably depends on the context and organizational structure.

To sum up, QAs are not primary standards setters in the broader sense but do play a key role in defining and enforcing internal quality processes. They ensure that the team adheres to agreed-upon standards, which might be set collaboratively with other roles.
```

**Quality Assurance (QA) professionals are not typically the sole "standards setters,"** but they play a **critical role in defining, upholding, and advocating for quality standards** within software development teams. Their influence depends on organizational structure, team culture, and the scope of their responsibilities. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. QA as Standards *Advocates***  
QAs champion quality by:  
- **Translating Requirements**: Ensuring functional/non-functional requirements align with industry standards (e.g., ISO 25010, WCAG accessibility).  
- **Enforcing Best Practices**: Promoting test-driven development (TDD), code reviews, and CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Educating Teams**: Highlighting the impact of technical debt, poor test coverage, or security vulnerabilities.  

---

### **2. QA as Standards *Co-Creators***  
In collaborative environments, QAs work with stakeholders to:  
- **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Collaborating with Product Owners and developers to set clear, testable conditions for user stories.  
- **Establish "Definition of Done" (DoD)**: Ensuring deliverables meet quality benchmarks (e.g., code coverage, accessibility compliance).  
- **Design Testing Frameworks**: Creating guidelines for automation, performance testing, or security scans.  

---

### **3. QA as Standards *Guardians***  
QAs enforce compliance by:  
- **Auditing Processes**: Verifying adherence to internal standards (e.g., code style, test coverage thresholds).  
- **Blocking Releases**: Halting deployments if critical bugs or regressions violate quality gates.  
- **Reporting Metrics**: Tracking defects, test coverage, and customer feedback to hold teams accountable.  

---

### **4. When QA *Does Not* Set Standards**  
- **External Standards**: Industry regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) or client requirements are often dictated externally.  
- **Architectural Decisions**: Technical standards (e.g., microservices vs. monoliths) are typically set by architects/developers.  
- **Business Priorities**: Trade-offs between speed and quality are often decided by leadership.  

---

### **5. Key Factors Influencing QA’s Role**  
| **Factor**                | **Impact on QA’s Standards Role**                  |  
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|  
| **Organizational Culture** | Agile/DevOps teams empower QA as equal collaborators. |  
| **Team Maturity**          | Mature teams embed QA early (shift-left testing).  |  
| **Industry**               | Regulated sectors (healthcare, finance) elevate QA’s authority. |  

---

### **6. Example Scenarios**  
- **Startup**: QA may define testing processes from scratch, acting as de facto standards setters.  
- **Enterprise**: QA enforces existing standards (e.g., ISO 9001) set by compliance teams.  
- **Outsourced Project**: QA aligns with client-mandated standards.  

---

### **7. Best Practices for QA to Influence Standards**  
1. **Collaborate Early**: Engage in sprint planning and refinement to shape requirements.  
2. **Leverage Data**: Use defect trends, escaped bugs, and customer feedback to justify stricter standards.  
3. **Build Alliances**: Partner with DevOps, Security, and Product teams to co-own quality.  

---

### **Key Takeaway**  
QA professionals are **standards influencers** rather than unilateral setters. They:  
- **Advocate** for quality as a shared responsibility.  
- **Co-create** standards with cross-functional teams.  
- **Guard** against deviations from agreed benchmarks.  

In organizations that prioritize quality, QA’s voice is pivotal in shaping standards. In others, they may need to proactively demonstrate the ROI of robust quality practices to gain influence.





# User Stories as Non-functional Requirements

User stories as the less obvious nonfunctional requirements

. One of the benefits of focusing on user stories is that it helps us get a better perspective than just looking at and thinking about a single functional requirement or just a nonfunctional requirement because a user's perspective is generally often both. What I mean by that is that they are interested in both functional and nonfunctional. They are interested in the core functionality of the system, but they also want quality aspects, like performance, reliability, usability. It's all part of the same experience as far as the user is concerned. And as I talked about earlier, 

we can write nonfunctional requirements as user stories, and they work well, allowing us to describe what is important and why it is important. 

But there are a couple of things to keep in mind. Phrasing is one of those things that is very important to keep in mind. 

For example, so, you can say I want the website to be reliable, so I don't get annoyed and leave. Now, it's true that there are certain nonfunctional requirements that could seem oddly specific when phrased as a user story. For example, being with a user story that acts as a nonfunctional requirement, like a website user, I want the website to be reliable so I don't get annoyed and leave. Okay. Now, the team would want to refine this further because they want to make it more measurable. So to make it more measurable, they'll say I want the website to be available 99.9% of the time, so I don't get frustrated and leave. Now that becomes measurable. It's unlikely that any one of the website users personally, you know, thinks in specific uptime percentages, but we will need to add a level of specificity that is buried under a more generic phrase, like reliable. But we could have also taken a slightly different perspective, not the user, but as the, let's say, CIO, Chief Information Officer, that I want the website to be available 99% of the time, so that our customers don't get frustrated and leave. But one thing worth mentioning, 

defining nonfunctional requirements as user stories like we're doing here is quite simple, but they don't often fall into that same level of achievable work. The availability of a website is something that has many different factors. So this isn't a user story that you're going to give to a developer and, here, go with it, you know, go ahead and do this. It needs to be clearly defined. It can still be given their own set of acceptance criteria and kept as a way to put a stake in the ground about this. 

Now, if you're following Scrum, nonfunctional requirements written as user stories are often treated as constraints in the backlog rather than individual achievable backlog items by themselves. And you simply need to stay aware of them behind the scenes, like reliability. It's not just an achieve and finish sort of a thing. As your system grows, you need to remember of this constraint that it needs to remain reliable. Constraints. Constraints themselves are something we're going to talk a lot more about in the next module because we've been very focused on nonfunctional requirements, mainly as quality aspects of a system, but these days we also need to be concerned about constraints, not just technical, but legal issues, governance, privacy, constraints around costs, business rules, deployment choices. So in the next module, we're going to get into that.
