1. concepts: navigation vs transaction 
	left side stepper: illusion of a nav bar
	it does not reflect the business workflow, it is not a navigation to independent resources, it has to be a transaction in sequential steps
	previous designer, and entire team, likely made the painful, difficult, but more thoughtful, more reasonable decision.

		overall: not recommended

2. promised functionalities:
		2.1 
	side effects
	when it is time to navigate, it is not navigating, for now
		2.2 code quality

			overall: will not approve

1. over hyped ui principles
	unpresentable, to whomï¼Œ
	balance:  aesthetics vs business flows, artists vs business clients
	3 buttons principle
	must be all modals principle

	balance: ae
example software
