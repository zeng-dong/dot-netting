1. concepts: navigation vs transaction 
	left side stepper: illusion of a nav bar
	it does not reflect the business workflow, it is not a navigation to independent resources, it has to be a transaction in sequential steps
	previous designer, and entire team, likely made the painful, difficult, but more thoughtful, more reasonable decision.

2. promised function:
	side effects
	when it is time to navigate, it is not navigating, for now

3. over hyped ui principles
	unpresentable, to whom
	3 buttons principle
	must be all modals principle
