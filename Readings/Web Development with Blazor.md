## Introducing WebAssembly
A binary instruction format
Compiled
Smaller
Designed for native speeds
Has a very strict security model
	- runs within a sandbox
	- cannot escape that sandbox without going through the appropriate APIs

Compile C code into WebAssembly: go to https://wasdk.github.io/WasmFiddle/ and enter int main() { return 1 + 2; }, press Build and then Run

WebAssembly is a stack machine language, which means that it uses a stack to perform its operations

Very performant. Unity, Unreal Engine, can be compiled into WebAssembly.
